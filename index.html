<h2>Summary Of Me</h2>

<p>I am currently attending Raritan Valley Community Collage studying Information Systems and Technology, I chose this major because I've always been interested in how computers work, all of their parts and want to obtain a career working with computers due to my fascination of them, it is also a subject that I have picked up well unlike others. Outside of school and computer science I enjoy playing video games and even built my own Gaming PC and then when I joined RVCC I became the VP of Info and Media of the video game club. I also enjoy the outdoors specifically in the spring and summer, while outdoors I like bike riding as a stress reliving exercise, going to the beach on the weekends in the summer, and when I'm able to I really enjoy kayaking with the favorite place I have done is through mangroves in South Florida. I also enjoy hanging out with friends and meeting new people I am someone who has gone from being an introvert to half extrovert, which is one reason why I joined the gaming club at RVCC, to meet new people in a new school and then help people by being in a leadership position later on. Overall I'm someone who is easy going, easy to talk to, fun to be around, and has a productive work ethic but also has indoor and outdoor hobbies. </p>

    <h2>Embedded static Google map using iFrame</h2>

    <p>Embedding a google map using Iframe is a method used to implement a specific map location into a website for users to reference. It's similar to implementing a video into a webpage for users to reference. They both take an item or program from a different webpage and embed it into your own in order to bring that feature to be used on your site. Adding a map to your site can be used to help guide people who visit your site to a specific destination that you're referencing. </p>

    <p>An example of embedding a google map into a site for it's purpose is say it's a school website that has all the schools information on it. If the website contains the schools address but not directions for you to get there you would then want to add the google maps destination for the school so the user knows what the property looks like and can click on the interactive map to get directions for how to get there from their specific destination. the best purpose for adding maps is to help people get to a specific destination that your site references. </p>
    
    
    <p> Implementing a google map into a site is a pretty simple process. First you go into google maps and look up or select a destination. Next you click on the share icon and select the embed code. Then copy and paste the embed code into the HTML section in your website code. A very similar process is done for the video embed section that was done previously. </p>

<p>I had a personal experience with this today when I was looking at a company I could possibly have an internship for this summer and they have maps implemented into their site for customers to know what their location looks like as well as how to get there which like a school also works perfectly for a business or any place that is being advertised. Using embed maps is much more convenient then what sites used to use. They used to write out directions to the place from a general location which can be very hard to use. Now with embed maps you can click on the destination, enter your own address or location and get direction for you that you just have to follow. It's one step further in the direction of technology being a tool to create more convenience.</p>

<p> In conclusion embed maps is used to add the maps image and feature into your site so you can get directions from your location and don't have to try to read through pages of directions to keep track of where you have to go. It's a simple thing to set up on your site for users simply by copying the code from google maps and adding it to a section in your HTML. Finally it's a useful tool used for businesses to help customers get to their location. Fortunately HTML has made it simple to add this to your site whether it's for information or advertising on a business. </p>
