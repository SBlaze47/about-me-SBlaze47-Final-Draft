# My About ME

I'm Shane Blazovic, I'm a Info Systems and Tech Major at RVCC and this is my summary of the Website I made in Web Dev 1. 

## **My About Me Website Description**

The purpose of the about me project was to give a semester long hands on activity to apply the topic we learned in class. Week by week we would learn new concepts of building a website and then we would apply those concepts hands on to make a website about ourselves piece by piece in seperate steps to which combined together made a whole webpage about me (hence the name of the project lol). 

I made the outline in the index.html file.

Next I used css which was most of the code in order to design the website to my choosing and in order to implament each part of the project.

Then I used images tags to insert an avatar picture of myself along with my photo gallery.

I also used paragraph tags to insert a text article into my webage.

Along with photos I added a video by linking a youtube video link to my webpage and then adding it to css to style it.

After that I added a contact form at the bottom with info inside of it being sent to Netlify

Second to last I made a navbar in it's own css file so the user can click on a spacific section to be taken right to that section.

Finally I added a footer with my name and a year stamp.
